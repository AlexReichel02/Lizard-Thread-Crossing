# Lizard-Thread-Crossing
This C++ project (*Linux Only*) creates multiple lizard threads that attempt to cross a river within a time slot so that they are not eaten by the cat thread.This project relies on mutex locks to protect critical sections and threads experiencing a semaphore with function calls such as sem_post and sem_wait.
